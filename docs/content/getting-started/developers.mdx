# Developers

## Install

You can install Circuit via npm or yarn. It relies on
[emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) and
[emotion-theming](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/tree/master/packages/emotion-theming) (as well as
React) being available in whatever project you are working on.

```bash
npm install @sumup/circuit-ui @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

```bash
yarn add @sumup/circuit-ui @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

## Configuring the theme

At the root of your application, you should tell your app which theme to use.
In most cases, you will want to use the SumUp default theme.

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming';
import { Button, theme } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme.standard}>
    <Button primary>Click me</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```

## Using components

Simply import components by name from the `@sumup/circuit-ui` package, as demonstrated
above.

## Using helpers

There are a few helpers you may want to use within Circuit.

## Injecting global styles

Sometimes you may need to apply global styles to your page. Here is how you can do this with the utilities provided by Circuit UI.

```javascript
import { GlobalStyles } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

const customStyles = `
  body {
    color: red;
  }
`;

<GlobalStyles custom={customStyles}/>

```
