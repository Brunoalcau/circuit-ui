# Selector

<Status.Stable/>

The selector is a component that allows merchants to select a single option from a range of items, keeping that selection
highlighted and allowing possible changes to happen on the same screen based on it.

<Playground>
  <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
    <Selector
      selected
      style={{ width: 'calc(50% - 4px)', marginRight: '12px' }}
    >
      Credit Card
    </Selector>
    <Selector style={{ width: 'calc(50% - 4px)' }}>Bank transfer</Selector>
  </div>
</Playground>

## When to use it

We should use a selector when we need the merchant to choose a critical option on the flows that impact the
same screen that they are currently in. For example, choosing a payment method on the order flow.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always position the selectable options on the same horizontal line for easy comparison
- **Do** provide the possible change on the content below the selector (for instance showing credit card input fields if merchants select this type of payment)
- **Do not** use a selector for more than 3 items. Consider using a select dropdown, instead.
