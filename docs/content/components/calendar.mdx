# Calendar

A calendar contains a view with actionable buttons in order to pick a range of dates 
and time frames for a specific task.

<Playground>
  <RangePicker/>
</Playground>


## When to use it

Calendars are used when we need our merchants to pick a specific time period in order to complete a task
or filter a subset of dated items (such as the transaction history, for example).

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** suggest frequently used selections, such as "Today", "Last month", and others.
- **Do** use the proper component variation depending on how you need the data input
- **Do not** use it when requiring dates very far from the present, such as a birth date.

## Component variations

### Range Picker

Used when the merchant needs to have clear visibility of selected start and end dates after the selection, 
for instance when a merchant needs to pick a time period within a form.

</Playground>

### Single Day Picker

Used when you the merchant only needs to select a single specific date. 

<Playground>
  <SingleDayPicker/>
</Playground>

### Calendar Tag

Used for cases where the merchant needs to select dates within the same month and that selection affects the data displayed. 

<Playground>
  <CalendarTag onDatesRangeChange={e => { console.log(e); }}/>
</Playground>

### Calendar Tag Two Step

Used for cases where the merchant needs to select dates that could be outside the same month and that selection affects the data displayed. 

<Playground>
  <CalendarTagTwoStep onDatesRangeChange={e => { console.log(e); }}/>
</Playground>
